## Developer Guides

### Introduction

There is one file to rule them all: [lib/audicom.js](https://github.com/AnTxXx/Engine/tree/master/lib/audicom.js).

It contains the AudiCom-Engine written in ES6. So if you want to use it you should be familiar with the
[EcmaScript 6.0 Standard](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0). A low level entry can be achieved reading
[An introduction to ES6](https://medium.com/sons-of-javascript/javascript-an-introduction-to-es6-1819d0d89a0f) by
Gerard Sans. If you are a tinkerer, you can also approach ES6 playing on [ES6Fiddle](http://www.es6fiddle.net/)
